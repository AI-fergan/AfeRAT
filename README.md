# AfeRAT
This RAT is a simple Trojan malware that can access the PC's camera, screen, and command line.

## Setup
First, ensure that you have port forwarding enabled on your router for the following ports: 2222 for screenshots, 3333 for camera access, and 4444 for command line access.
Once that's done, the setup process is very easy. Simply run the server on your machine and download the RAT onto the remote computer. After that, you will see all the remote RATs listed by their IDs on the server console, and you can easily control them.
